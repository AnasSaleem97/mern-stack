**BloodLink** is a mission-critical MERN stack application designed to bridge the gap between blood donors and recipients. It features real-time matching, automated medical verification, and a multi-tiered administrative dashboard to ensure every drop counts.

## 🧩 The Problem vs. Our Solution

Before BloodLink, blood donation was hindered by manual record-keeping and slow communication. Here is how we engineered the fix:

* **The Problem:** Delayed response times during critical blood shortages.


* **The Solution:** **Real-time Socket.IO alerts** that notify compatible donors within a 10km radius instantly when a "Critical" request is created.




* **The Problem:** Risks to donor and recipient health due to lack of medical history tracking.


* **The Solution:** An **Eligibility Interval Enforcement** system that blocks donations if the 56-day cooldown period hasn't passed.




* **The Problem:** High administrative workload in verifying donors.


* **The Solution:** **Automated Eligibility Logic** that pre-filters users based on BMI and age before they even reach the medical queue.
