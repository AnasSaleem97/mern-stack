## 🚨 The Industry Problem: The "Linkage Gap"

Historically, students and guest applicants have struggled with a fragmented internship landscape. **University students** are often limited to local placements, while **Guest/External applicants** have no centralized way to access industry-vetted internships. On the other side, **Software Houses** face an administrative bottleneck when vetting hundreds of manual applications from multiple sources.

## 💡 The Solution: A Unified Internship Ecosystem

**AIILP** is a high-performance linkage platform that centralizes the entire internship lifecycle. It provides a **single, transparent platform** where both university-enrolled students and guest applicants can build professional CVs, apply to industry-vetted roles, and track their status in real-time.
