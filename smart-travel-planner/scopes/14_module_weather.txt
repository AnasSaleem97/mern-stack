MODULE 14 — Weather (Real-Time Weather + Forecast)

1) Module goal
- Provide real-time weather and forecast for selected destination.
- Provide travel tips based on temperature/conditions.

2) Frontend implementation
- File: frontend/src/pages/Weather.js
Key flows
- On mount:
  - GET /travel-hub
  - Selects the first destination and auto-fetches weather
- Fetch weather:
  - GET /travel-hub/weather?destination=<name>
- Provides travel tips rules in UI based on temperature and condition (rain/cold/etc.)

3) Backend implementation
- Implemented inside Travel Hub controller:
  - GET /api/travel-hub/weather
- Requires WEATHER_API_KEY.
- Uses OpenWeatherMap geocoding + current weather + 5-day forecast.

4) Database usage
- Reads destinations from Destination collection (names/cities/country/coordinates).

5) External APIs
- OpenWeatherMap (WEATHER_API_KEY)

6) Known gaps / issues
- If Destination collection is empty, the Weather page shows alerts and cannot function.
- If WEATHER_API_KEY is missing, backend returns an error message.

7) How to test
- Ensure destinations exist in DB
- Set WEATHER_API_KEY
- Login
- Open /weather and verify data loads
