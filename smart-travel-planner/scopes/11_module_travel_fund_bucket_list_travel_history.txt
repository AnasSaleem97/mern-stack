MODULE 11 — Travel Fund + Bucket List + Travel History (Budgets/Trips CRUD)

1) Module goal
- Persist trip budgets and plans.
- Provide:
  - Travel Fund: list of saved budgets (non-bucket-list)
  - Bucket List: destinations wishlist (bucket-list budgets)
  - Travel History (Diary): manage trips with dates/status/notes/rating, export/share

2) Frontend implementation
A) Travel Fund page
- File: frontend/src/pages/TravelFund.js
- On mount: GET /travel-fund
- Filters out isBucketList items
- Delete: DELETE /travel-fund/:id

B) Bucket List page
- File: frontend/src/pages/BucketList.js
- Destinations tab:
  - GET /travel-fund/bucket-list
  - For each item tries to fetch destination details via:
    - GET /travel-hub/destinations?search=...
    - NOTE: this endpoint does NOT exist; Travel Hub endpoint is /travel-hub with query search.
  - Fallbacks to placeholder description/tags.
- Accommodations tab:
  - fetches all hotels (not actually “saved”) and slices first 10
  - delete tries: DELETE /places-to-stay/saved/:id (NOT implemented)
- Trip plans tab:
  - GET /travel-fund and filters !isBucketList

C) Travel History (Travel Diary)
- File: frontend/src/pages/TravelHistory.js
- On mount: GET /travel-fund
- Filters out bucket list items
- Supports:
  - Update trip: PUT /travel-fund/:id (edit status/dates/accommodation/rating/notes)
  - Delete trip: DELETE /travel-fund/:id
  - Share (navigator.share) / Copy to clipboard
  - Add to calendar (opens Google Calendar URL)
  - Export CSV

3) Backend implementation
Routes (auth protected)
- File: backend/src/routes/travelFundRoutes.js
  - GET /api/travel-fund
  - GET /api/travel-fund/bucket-list
  - POST /api/travel-fund
  - GET /api/travel-fund/:id
  - PUT /api/travel-fund/:id
  - DELETE /api/travel-fund/:id

Controller
- File: backend/src/controllers/travelFundController.js
- Storage model: Budget
- Bucket list uniqueness:
  - if isBucketList=true, prevents duplicate destination for same user

4) Database usage
- Model: backend/src/models/Budget.js
Important fields used
- destination, numberOfMembers, days, season
- breakdown + total
- isBucketList
- status (planned/confirmed/completed/cancelled)
- startDate/endDate/accommodation/rating/notes

5) Known gaps / issues
- BucketList fetches destination details from a non-existing endpoint:
  - /travel-hub/destinations?search=... should be /travel-hub?search=...
- Saved accommodations feature is not implemented in backend, but UI attempts deletion.

6) How to test
- Login
- Save a budget from MoneyMap
- Verify:
  - /travel-fund shows it
  - /travel-history lists it and allows update
- Add bucket list item from TravelHub
- Verify /bucket-list destinations tab shows it
